My father, first and foremost, influenced and inspired me to learn to code. He introduced me to the world of technology at a very young age and is thus responsible for my attachment to tech. As the co-founder of Landware, a mobile software company, I had my hands (ableit tiny) on Palm Pilots and GameBoys as soon as I was old enough to find the power button.

In addition to my father, video games were another major influence and inspiration for me as a coder. The joy I felt from playing video games during my juvenile years compelled me to desire the creation of my own digital games. Learning that the multi-platformed 3D games I was playing were the result of thousands of lines of code reshaped my aspirations as an adult.

Now though, the problems that most interest me and that I want to solve are twofold. One, I would like to learn to code a device that can interact with the human brain. This device would store information (such as a wikipedia article) in a format interpretable by the brain. Once connected to the human blood stream, the information would be digested and learned. The second problem or rather creation I would like to code is my very own music software. Basically, learn how to use Max by Cycling 74.
